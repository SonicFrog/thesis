To provide a key-value store with consistent latency independent from
keys and values sizes we need to eliminate copies from the key-value
store's datapath while still ensuring reliable delivery of responses
to requests. We leverage several feature of the Rust programming
language to achieve zero-copy reliable delivery of key-value store
responses through the R2P2 protocol.

% The state of the art today for high-speed networking involves kernel
% bypassing techniques making use of software such as DPDK to reduce the
% overhead typically associated with kernel based networking. Such
% software is usually much faster than traditional kernel networking,
% mostly due to avoidance of context switches and data copies between
% kernel and user space, especially when processing lots of small
% packets which often happens in the case of key-value stores such as
% memcached. Nonetheless these systems are far from perfect. First,
% having all the  networking code and the user application inside the
% same address space means that user code can corrupt the networking
% stack very easily. Secondly, development of such applications is also
% much more cumbersome than traditional kernel based approaches, indeed
% having the user program in the same address space as the networking
% code creates the need for it to be aware of low level networking
% details that traditional applications don't need to worry about.The
% necessity to handle this kind of networking details make kernel bypass
% application much more time consuming and error-prone to develop than
% regular socket based ones. Another problem these kind of systems
% encounter is their inability to ensure safety, since contrary to
% kernel based systems the networking stack and the user application
% share a virtual address space languages like C do not provide
% sufficient safety guarantees when data is shared between multiple
% threads.

\marios{You need a flat abstract without subsection where you clearly
  state the problem. "We need to eliminate copies in a KV-store's
  datapath. Thus we use language features to reason about data
  onwership." You mention that we use Rust for that without any
  details. You mention that the solution is for reliable transport
  protocols and we use R2P2 without getting into details. And then you
  state some basic performance numbers.}
